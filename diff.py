    """
    This function shows how well predicted quizzes fit to actual solutions.
    It will store sum of differences for each pair (solution, guess)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    grids_true (np.array), shape (?, 9, 9): Real solutions to guess in the digit repesentation
    grids_pred (np.array), shape (?, 9, 9): Guesses
    
    Returns
    -------
    diff (np.array), shape (?,): Number of differences for each pair (solution, guess)
